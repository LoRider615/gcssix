  <h2>You wake up in a cold and dark metal room. You hear a robotic voice being emitted through speakers. It sounds sweet, but also uncannily cold.<br><br>
    ????: Hello new recruit, (null)! I'm Suise, your friendly Government Computer! Now now darling, no need to panic, as you've just been given a new job! I will give you tasks to complete, and if you have an exceptional performance, then you night just get out of servitude for life!<br><br>
    Susie: If you fail to complete your tasks, a family member will be executed. Now then, your first task is to kill this old man, there's an army standard issue laser gun on the floor behind you.<br><br>
    The lights turn on and you see a man on his knees, blindfolded, his mouth gagged, and his hands tied behind his back, you pick up the gun.
